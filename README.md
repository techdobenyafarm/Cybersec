Information on researches of internet of things
The evolution of IOTs have taken people from one space to another. Internet is another space where everyone had visited willy-nilly. Before the dot.com days people used to send paper written message by couriers and hand postmen but nowadays fingertips are busy on handhelds devices without mentioning the laptops and other computers family gadgets. 

Good things comes with bad things. We can not say the IOTs (as I can combine all machines which are instructed by a set of codes for them to operate and communicate with their emvironment,in this group name) is very good nor I say is bad one has own views The purpose of this site is to give an insight of security, how can one sail from one planet to another with reduced risk and improved opportunities. We will try to bring evidence or proof of concepts done by various renowned researchers from the globe. I accept those who say we are in a global village, thanks to github.com for giving me this privilege.
